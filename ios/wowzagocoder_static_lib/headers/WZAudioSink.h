 captured, or audio level changes.

/*!
 Called for each frame of audio recorded by an audio device. The format of the data is uninteresting
 to the protocol adopter; this protocol should be used for timing information only. If you wish to access
 raw audio data, please implement the audioPCMFrameWasCaptured protocol method instead of this one.
 @param data
 The audio frame data.
 @param size
 The size, in bytes, of the captured frame
 @param time
 The audio frame time, represented in a CMTime structure
 @param sampleRate
 The audio sample rate

/*!
 Called for each frame of audio recorded by an audio device. Clients implementing this protocol should be aware
 that doing so causes the SDK to go through a PCM to AAC audio conversion process before broadcasting. Thus, please
 DO NOT IMPLEMENT THIS PROTOCOL UNLESS YOU HAVE A SPECIFIC NEED FOR THE UN-ENCODED AUDIO DATA. If you implement this
 protocol, the audioFrameWasCaptured protocol method will never be called.
 
 Note that implementing this protocol doesn't guarentee that it will be called. If the audio converter is unable for any
 reason to convert from PCM to AAC, then the capture hardware will fall back to capturing AAC directly; in which case
 the audioFrameWasCaptured protocol above will be called instead.
 
 @param pcmASBD
 The AudioStreamBasicDescription of the PCM data
 @param bufferList
 The AudioBufferList representation of the PCM data.
 @param time
 The audio frame time, represented in a CMTime structure

 Test whether or not the audio sink adopting this protocol can convert from the specified format description. It would be very
 unusual for a client to implement this protocol; it is implemented by the WZAACEncoder class.
