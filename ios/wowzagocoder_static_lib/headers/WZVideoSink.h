 *  Called for each frame of unencoded video produced by a video producer.
 *
 *  @param imageBuffer
 *  The image data. Pixel format should be kCVPixelFormatType_32BGRA
 *
 *  @param framePresentationTime
 *  The relative presentation time for this frame. Implementers of this protocol should
 *  handle the case where framePresentationTime is kCMTimeInvalid. In such cases, the protocol
 *  implementer shoud infer the presentation time based on the time that the frame is delivered.
 *  The WZH264Encoder works this way.
 *
 *  @param frameDuration
 *  The duration time for this frame. Use kCMTimeInvalid for default duration.
